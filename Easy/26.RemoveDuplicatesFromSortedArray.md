# 26. Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

>Hint
Description says do not allocate extra space, so no set
if you use the same index i in the for loop and remove and raverse at the same time, the list will be messed up. So the best solution is to have a number tracking the index and add only when remove is not performed (because if removed the next index is automatically the same one as before)

## Python
```
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        cur = -101
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] <= cur:
                nums.remove(nums[i])
                #remove了之后当前index不变
            else:
                cur = nums[i]
                i = i+1
        return len(nums)
```
