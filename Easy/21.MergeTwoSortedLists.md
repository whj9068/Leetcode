# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

>Hints:
curr list should first point to a dummy
when ever curr.next is point to something remember to move curr to its next
keep a head pointing to dummy and return head.next at the end

```

# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):

        curr = ListNode(-101)
        head = curr

        while list1 and list2:
            if (list1.val < list2.val):
                curr.next = ListNode(list1.val)
                curr = curr.next

                curr = curr.next
                list2 = list2.next

        elif list2:
            curr.next = list2

        return head.next
