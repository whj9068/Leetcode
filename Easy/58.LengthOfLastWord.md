# 58. Length of Last Word
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

>Hint: .split() without giving it any argument, Python treats any sequence of whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) as a single separator and automatically removes empty strings from the result.
split(" "): ['Hello', '', '', 'World', '', '', '']   # has empty strings from extra spaces
split(): ['Hello', 'World']                        # no empty strings
```
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        split = s.split()
        return len(split[-1])
        ```
